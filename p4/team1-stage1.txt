Here we see the project in its initial state. The main screen shows the programs name and the various places on the primary cartouche are seen. To the left and right are the token holders that hold the tokens for the categories of foods and the item selection tokens for the individual item numbers. Across the top are buttons for selecting the data that the user wishes to be displayed. They may be turned on and off for the persons decided type. Towards the middle are the Token read areas for holding the tokens when they are placed on the table. This limits the area in which they are read and allows only one user at a time.
