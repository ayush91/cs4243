team1-stage2: Selection States

This shows the state of the table after a token from the categories section has been added. The bottom screen will show the list of items under that category and it is then that the user may choose an item from the item tokens to place in the read area. This will allow them to select an item from the menu. It is not yet decided what will be shown on the upper screen at this time we may duplicate the menu so that others may watch or simply leave it as the programs name.
