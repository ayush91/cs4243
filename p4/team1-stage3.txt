team1-stage3: Data Selection

This shows the state of the table after an item has been selected and two of the data buttons have been pressed. At the time of item selection a picture of item is placed on the lower screen. This is a visual representation of the type of food they have chosen. Each button across the top represents a different type of data pertaining to the item. The screen across the top will adjust to meet which ever types are wished to be shown. This allows the user to choose what interests them most and display it all either individually or all at once.
